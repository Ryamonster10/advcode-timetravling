# The Time Traveler's Code Challenge

## Background
Imagine you are a time traveler who needs to send messages across different eras without altering the course of history. Your task is to create a code system that can encode and decode messages in a way that is undetectable by people from those eras.

## Challenge Description

### Task Overview
Develop a program that can encode and decode messages using a unique, time-traveler-specific method. Your code should include both the encoding and decoding mechanisms.

### Core Requirements

#### 1. Encoding Mechanism
- Create an innovative encoding algorithm. This could involve pattern shifting, mathematical operations, string manipulations, or any creative method you devise.
- The encoded message should appear innocuous or nonsensical to an unintended observer.

#### 2. Decoding Mechanism
- Implement a decoding algorithm that precisely reverses the encoding process.
- Ensure that the decoded message perfectly matches the original input.

#### 3. User Interface
- Develop a simple user interface (UI) for inputting the message, selecting encoding/decoding, and displaying the result.
- The UI can be command-line based or graphical, depending on your preference and skill set.

#### 4. Originality and Creativity
- The method of encoding and decoding should be original and creative. Avoid common or well-known cipher techniques.

### Additional Guidelines
- **Efficiency:** The algorithm should be efficient in terms of computation.
- **Robustness:** The program should handle different types of input gracefully and be resilient to user errors.
- **Documentation:** Clearly comment your code to explain how the encoding and decoding mechanisms work.

### Optional Enhancements
- **Complexity Levels:** Include options for different levels of encoding complexity.
- **Historical Context:** Allow the user to select a historical era, and adjust the encoding method to be contextually appropriate for that time period.
- **Encryption:** Add an extra layer of security by implementing a basic encryption before the encoding process.

## Evaluation Criteria
Submissions will be judged based on creativity, originality, efficiency, robustness, and the quality of documentation. Bonus points for implementing optional enhancements.

## Submission Instructions
- Ensure your code is well-commented and clearly structured.
- Provide a brief README explaining how to run your program and any dependencies required.
- Submit your source code files and any additional materials before the deadline.
